.SH NAME
sp-error-visualizer \- tool to display errors as banners
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sp-error-visualizer
.RI [ -s ] [ -f

.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B sp-error-visualizer 
provides a way of displaying text content (optionally filtered against a set of patterns) as banners. The primary purpose of this tool is to provide a way to display various error messages from syslog in a more easily visible manner to the developers and testers.
.PP
All data to be potentially displayed is received either via the standard input or via syslog socket (useful if the environment does not have a syslog daemon). By default everything will be displayed. Invividual messages are terminated by linefeeds in addition to the usual NULL terrmination. Additionally, messages longer than 256 bytes will be truncated to that limit.
.PP
Currently, a maximum of 256 matching patterns are supported. The patterns can be provided either from a file (see
.B -f
option below) or as a series of arguments. When reading from file, some preprocessing will be done:

.IP 
\(bu Patterns lines starting with '#' are interprepted as comments and ignored.
.sp 1
\(bu Empty lines will be ignored.
.sp 1
\(bu Whitespace is preserved in the patterns and will also be used in matching. 
.PP
This package includes an initscript for a convenient way to start and stop the displaying of errors and other interesting messages from syslog with a preconfigured set of matching rules.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
For a complete description, see the source code.
.TP

Use syslog socket instead of the syslog daemon logfile to receive messages. However, attempts to use this option will fail if the logfile can be found.
.SH FILES
.B /var/run/sp-error-visualizer.pid
.RS 
When started via the provided initscript, this file contains the PID of syslog-displaying sp-error-visualizer instance.
