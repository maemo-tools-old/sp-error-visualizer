.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B sp-error-visualizer 
provides a way of displaying text content (optionally filtered against a set of patterns) as banners. The primary purpose of this tool is to provide a way to display various error messages from syslog in a more easily visible manner to the developers and testers.
.PP
All data to be potentially displayed is received via the standard input. By default everything will be displayed. Invividual messages are terminated by linefeeds in addition to the usual NULL terrmination. Additionally, messages longer than 256 bytes will be truncated to that limit.
.PP
Currently, a maximum of 256 matching patterns are supported. The patterns can be provided either from a file (see
.B -f
option below) or as a series of arguments. When reading from file, some preprocessing will be done:

.IP 
\(bu Patterns lines starting with '#' are interprepted as comments and ignored.
.sp 1
\(bu Empty lines will be ignored.
.sp 1
\(bu Whitespace is preserved in the patterns and will also be used in matching. 
.PP
This package includes an initscript for a convenient way to start and stop the displaying of errors and other interesting messages from syslog with a preconfigured set of matching rules.
